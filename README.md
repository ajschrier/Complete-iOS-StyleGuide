*Note: This is still a work in progress*

Variables
---------
Variables should be named descriptively and avoid use of acronyms. Pointer asterisk should be with the variable name. If the variable is of a common type, avoid putting that in the name. Variable names should start with a lowercase letter and be camelcased.

**Examples**
```Objective-C
//Good
NSString *carModel = @"Mustang";
CGFloat noteViewWidth = 30;


//Bad
NSString * carModelString = @"Mustang";
CGFloat nwidth = 30;
```

Methods
-------
Methods should be formatted as so (notice the space after the scope symbol)

```Objective-C
//Instance method
- (void)buildJSONRequestFromString:(NSString *)request withTag:(int)tag;
 
//Class method
+ (XYZString *)uppercaseStringFromString:(NSString *)string;
```
Method names should be as descriptive as possible. Avoid using names that start off with *set* or *get* unless it is a setter or getter method. Also avoid the prefix *is* unless it returns a BOOL.


Class Headers
------------
Header files should be organized as so:

```Objective-C
//Import statements first. Import in this order: superclass, frameworks, local classes
#import "XYZSuperView.h"
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import "XYZCar.h"

//Classes should be forward declared whenever possible
@Class XYZDriver;
@Class XYZPassenger;

//Any protocol definitions next. Protocol should always include the class name in its own name.
@protocol XYZNoteViewDelegate <NSObject>

- (void)closedPopover;

@end

//Interface
@interface XYZNoteView : XYZSuperView <XYZCarDelegate>

//Properties - Only properties that need to be included publicly. Otherwise, define in the .m file
@property (nonatomic, strong) XYZDriver *driver;

//Even create properties for C primitive types
@property int numberOfCrashes;

//Instance methods
- (NSString *)driverNameFromDriver:(Driver *)driver;

//Class methods
+(XYZNoteView *)noteViewFromPassenger:(Passenger *)passenger;
```
